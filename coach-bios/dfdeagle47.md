Born in 1990 in Belgium, I've always been interested in learning new things especially in science-related fields.

When I was 6, my family bought a computer and I started spending a lot of time with it. At first, to play video games, and later on I started tinkering with PHP.

At 13, I moved to the US with my family. Motivated by my interest in video games such as [Half-Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)) (then [Half-Life 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2)) which let you modify the game using programming, I picked up a book on C++ and started developping (mostly useless :)) mods.

I came back to Belgium to study (physics) engineering at university at 18. During my studies, I helped out friends with various programming projects and learning to work in different languages (C++, Python, MATLAB, ...). I also spent a lot of time thinking about how to learn and transmit knowledge effectively.

After finishing my degree, I joined a company as a C# developer and worked on a side-project in web development in Angular.js. In 2015, after a year (and a complete re-write of the project), it became my main job as I co-founded [wooclap](https://www.wooclap.com/) with a friend. Our goal is to transform smartphone into learning tools by letting the teacher ask questions to their students in real-time.

wooclap is written in [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the back-end, intially [backbone.js](https://backbonejs.org/) and [Marionnette.js](https://marionettejs.com/) for the front-end (later replaced by [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Ampersand.js](https://ampersandjs.com/)) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database. We also heavily use [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) for our infrastructure.


Some of my hobbies include: science-related stuff, language learning, long-distance running/cycling (and recently climbing).
