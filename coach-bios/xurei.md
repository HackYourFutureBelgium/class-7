Hi there !

My name is Olivier. I was born in 1987. 

I discovered programming early, around my 13 - when the Internet was not yet a thing.
I started web development at 16, and I'm working in the field since then.
I have 9 profesionnal years of experiences.

These days, I'm mostly working with Javascript and React. 
I also know PHP, Java, C++, and I have basic knowledge of most popular languages (Python, Bash, Ruby, Go...)

I worked with several startups as a freelancer and created my owns recently (work in progress... ;-) ).

I also maintain a few open-source repositories. Check [my github account](https://github.com/xurei) for more infos.

I'm passionate about UX (User Experience), ergonomy, productivity and human-machine interfaces.

I also play Role-Playing games (D&D, Numenera, Chtulhu) and like to solve puzzles.
