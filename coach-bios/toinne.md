ðŸ‘‹Hi I am Anthony

As a kid you could always find me in front of computer.
Man rollercoaster tycoon was an addicting game.

Started programming during my bachelors degree Electronics and ICT.
That does not mean I can fix your {insert computer problem}.

I have 6 years of professional experience in webdevelopment mostly in PHP and Javascript.
But I have a basic knowledge of most of the common other languages like Ruby, Java, C# and Python.

Today I am a Lead developer which means beyond coding I coordinate a team of other developers.
Helping them grow, learn and work efficiently.

I love history, in my spare time you will find me watching a documentary or playing some kind of history based game.
Also the kind of person that thinks museums are the best thing ever.
Also the proud owner of a modest record collection so I you know about a new great band let me know !

Cheers
